    "Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is arguably the most popular programming paradigm. It refers to a \"style\" of programming, partly in the user's control and partly emphasized by the programming language itself. Python, for example, was built from the start as an OOP language. That means that much of the language's built-ins follow and OOP design, and making your own objects is easy. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Disclaimer:** OOP is a powerful and popular programming paradigm. It is not, however, the only one. Some people have very, *very* strong opinions on this. For the next hour, we'll ignore those people. However, keep in mind going forward there are other was to design a program, and OOP is not always the best way! "
