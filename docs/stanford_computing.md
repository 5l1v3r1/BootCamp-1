## Stanford's Shared Computing Environment

Anyone with a SUNet ID should have access to Stanford's Linux computing resources, which can be accessed by `ssh` using your SUNet credentials and are documented [here](https://uit.stanford.edu/service/sharedcomputing). These include nodes for
* low-intensity computing such as email (_cardinal.stanford.edu_)
* general interactive computing, including most analysis with runtimes <1 day (_rice.stanford.edu_)
* non-interactive high-performance computing (_wheat.stanford.edu_, _oat.stanford.edu_)
