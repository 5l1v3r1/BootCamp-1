The bulk of this tutorial is written in [Unix (1).ipynb](Unix (1).ipynb) and [Unix (2).ipynb](Unix (2).ipynb). We found that it was better to do a live demonstration in a linux shell rather than installing the bash kernel for Jupyter, so [Unix (1).ipynb](Unix (1).ipynb) was repurposed into [Unix (1).sh](Unix (1).sh).

Files necessary for the tutorial are stored in files_for_practice.tar.gz

More detailed information on `ssh` and GNU `screen` are in their respective markdown files.
